# Healthcare Document Chat API

An intelligent **FastAPI-based backend service** that processes healthcare documents and enables natural language chat interactions over their content using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**.

It integrates:

- Document ingestion and text extraction
- Text preprocessing and intelligent chunking
- Vector embeddings for semantic retrieval
- Conversational AI via RAG pipeline
- Medical entity recognition and healthcare-specific responses
